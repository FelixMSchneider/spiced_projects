Until wealth is seen as life-destroying, nothing will fundamentally change. Climate change is not the major problem we have, it is adoration of wealth.

@Johnbloodrage @JustStop_Oil @rickygervais And who do you think will be the most impacted by climate change? When there is a heatwave that makes people's houses burn, when there is a hurricane that makes entire cities flooded, when there is crop failure that makes food prices go much higher.

@PoliticalTeacup @MrsCosmopolite @simonhardcastle @carmig1611 @StyleHelen1 If it hasn't yet reached that level, when on earth will it? Time to stop being so polite about this, the planet is burning. Climate change is the opposite of a political issue - it affects every person on Earth - and I'd welcome his input and using his platform to spur change.
